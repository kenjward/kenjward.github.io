title: A scrap from January 2016

### General overview: Classes, great! Life, great!

That seems to be the general idea of grad school, really&mdash;as goes coursework, so goes much of life. Now, I don't want to give anyone the impression that I didn't enjoy most of my courses last semester. I did. Generally, they were fantastic and challenged me in ways no classes had before. 

_However_, in terms of matching up with my research interests and academic goals, they weren't a terrific fit. I took a course in quantitative methods; I don't really use quantitative methods in my research. My course at the Contemporary History Institute was great, but it didn't specifically hit on any of my interests. I took a course called magazine feature research, which was also a lot of fun, but I took it more to learn how to teach a similar class, not because of the content (although, it should be mentioned, I got a start on my dissertation epilogue out of this course).

But _no complaining here_, because all's well that ends well! This semester is a very solid fit with my interests. I didn't see that coming. Environmental history? What the hell is that? Why should I be interested in that noise? Critical cultural theory? A bunch of nonsense, that must be. The only class that I expected to be up my alley was biography.

Turns out I was waaaay wrong there. Environmental history meshes perfectly with my research in the American West. There are theories within the critical cultural realm that I could see working their way into my dissertation pretty seamlessly (political economy in particular). And biography is biography&mdash;it's a dead ringer.

So coursework-wise, this semester is going great. It's tough to put this stuff down and spend some time detoxing, about equally because of the workload and because it's crazy interesting.

### Research: Frohwerk, the world must know your story

Throw on top of that a kickass research project and you've got a real sweet mix. This semester I'm RAing for Prof. Aimee Edmondson, who does comm law and journalism history both. She sent me out a couple of weeks ago to collect some information on a Mr. Jacob Frohwerk of Kansas City, Kansas, who got himself prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act for some editorials he wrote (in English) in the German-language Missouri Staats-Zeitung. This project combined two research interests of mine in journalism history: the Great Plains region and the German-language press.

I've had fun over the past couple of weeks trying to nail down who this guy is. Despite the importance of his case, which is high, very little is known or published about the guy. So I dug into obituaries, census records and city directories to see if I could pin down which Jacob Frohwerk we're talking about and try to develop an outline of a biographical sketch. I'm making major progress; I can rattle off birthdays of him and his family, residences and occupations, deaths, and the core concerns of such a sketch. There's going to be a beauty of a paper in there, and I'll put up what I have soon.

The best part is, my name will be on that paper. Aimee asked today if I would like to coauthor the paper. I naturally said yes. I get to spend the next couple of months cozying up with Herr Frohwerk as we try to get this thing done by April. 

**I haven't been this excited about anything I've done since moving here.** Historical research rocks!

### Good news: Fellowship fun and sticking on with *Journalism History*

A few parting pieces of good news that also came along today. First, I will be receiving one of the Scripps-Howard Teaching Fellowships at Ohio University, to begin next fall. I think I'm going to insist that everyone refer to me as Fellow Ward. 

Speaking of teaching (briefly), that's going very well. I've absolutely buried myself with grading because of the way I've set the course up, but I think it will pay off for the students in the long run. It's fun working with freshmen again, and they seem excited to be working on the craft. Now I just have to make that last ...

Last bit of fun. Even though I'm not RAing for my advisor, Prof. Mike Sweeney, anymore, I'm still going to be working on *Journalism History* as a copyeditor. I'm going to work through about eight articles over the next few months in exchange for some money to go gather dissertation materials in Colorado over the summer. It's a win-win. It's going to make my schedule even tighter, but it's definitely worth it in the long run. The latest issue is out, by the way.
