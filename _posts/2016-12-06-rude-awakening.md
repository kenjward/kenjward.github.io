This isn't my first run at blogging. I've been doing it off and on for years. Maybe getting close to ten, if you count my really abortive early tries that have been lost to the depths of the web.

I'm really excited to get started this time. Part of that was because I thought I had an entire blog to bring with me. I used to host this with BlueHost at kenjward.com, but I let that lapse in May. I've been flying without a personal site since. However, I thought I had all my old posts backed up on my computer and could just move them over to this new home. Thus, I'd really just be continuing what I'd begun, building on an already sizeable pile of content.

Wrong. It's all gone.

I don't know what happened, but the folder in which everything was supposed to be backed up is empty. So I have to build this whole blog from the ground up. It's a huge bummer, because I had lots of reflections about moving from Kansas to Ohio in there, and they've vanished. 

Here's to starting from scratch.
