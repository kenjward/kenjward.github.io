I sort of forgot this website was sitting out there, but I'm glad it is. After teaching social media last year fairly uncritically, I've now divorced myself from regular social media engagement.

It's not that social media are inherently bad. But I have ethical objections to nearly every level of the modern social media system. Users dig themselves into ideological bunkers, while the very architecture of the platforms ensures that even well-meaning users will have the ideas to which they are exposed artificially limited. Of course, all that junk content (and, sadly, it's largely junk content like junk memes and Buzzfeed links rather than actual user-generated content made for friends and family) is associated with individual users and mined at every possible opportunity, creating masses of aggregate data that can be manipulated every which way. You may get a say in who of your friends sees which message, but you certainly don't get to choose whether or not your data is passed on to data brokers or used to further isolate you with tailored content that panders to what advertisers think are your interests.

Rant over. But as I've stopped posting on Facebook and Twitter, the two social network sites on which I'm expected to be active, a brief comment justifying my actions is appropriate.

On a personal note: sounds like my daughter is going to be born in two days. Like, there's today, then Thursday, and then Friday I'll have a baby. Right now I'm alternating every few second between joy and terror. Can you guess where pictures of my baby will _not_ be posted?
